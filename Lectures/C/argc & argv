argc is the count of arguments, and argv is an array of the strings.

The program itself is the first argument, argv[0], so argc is always at least 1.

the program itself is included in the arguement count. 

So in your program, argc is required to be 2 which consists of: your_program and another_file. 
If argc is not 2, this means it is equal to 1 or it is greater than 2 and since this is not what the program wants,
the code aborts further execution
